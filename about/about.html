    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to the Collective Opposition to Present Entrepreneurs, COPE. Here at COPE, our goal is to
    save old and dying companies. We have constantly put endless passion and campaigning into saving these
    companies and helping revive dead businesses. We want the government to provide such dying companies with
    money and subsidies to keep them alive and well. Our company list includes <i>Toys R Us</i>, <i>Blockbuster</i>,
    <i>Kodak</i>, <i>Radioschack</i>, and more.
    <br><br>
    We here at COPE are campaigning against present entrepreneurs, hence the acronym. Modern businesses such as
    Amazon are monopolizing and oligopolizing markets and preventing smaller and older businesses from keeping up.
    We would like government regulation over such businesses to slow them down in order to help smaller companies.
    <br><br>
    Many do not support COPE, saying that it would be impractical for the public market. However, we firmly believe
    that these companies had society in a better place as a whole, and that many will be better off with them back
    in their lives.
    <br><br>
    When in doubt, <strong><i>COPE</strong></i>.
